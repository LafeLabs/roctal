# Roctal  \m/

ROctal is a system for encoding data using a combination of binary and octal to make the product as readable as possible both for a human and a machine.  It is a geometric system for encoding data, independent of the medium in which the geometry is printed.  Media which this is designed for include:

 - ink on paper printed with printer
 - transmission from one computer device to another via screen-to-camera link
 - carved stone, metal, brick
 - metal(gold) deposited on silicon
 - electrochemical patterning on the native oxide of aluminum, then coating with polymer
 - farmers' fields for readability from space cameras
 - marker on paper, by hand or by robot
 - laser cutting
 - electron beam lithography, optical lithography etc.
 
 The purpose of this code is to connect information with physical objects and with the human mind with as close a link as possible.  For implementation in current technology the best way to use it is as an app for a mobile device like a tablet, smart phone or embedded system, which integrates a camera or other transducer into software that creates human-interpretable or machine-interpretable code.  
 
 Some of the information which might be encoded this way includes:
 
 - encoding of .stl file which created a physical thing printed from 3d printer
 - recording and playback of music and other sounds without connection to the tech enemy
